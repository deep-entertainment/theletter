## Why release those files?

> I'm a fanboy of open licenses and constantly use software and art 
> under an open license, be it as a developer or an artist.
>
> I use open resources as a basis for my own resources or learn from them.
>
> Because of that I see it as an obligation to open stuff I've made myself.
>
> In the team, we couldn't agree to fully release all game assets under
> an open license, which I absolutely respect.
>
> So this repository only contains resources I made and for which I hold
> the sole copyright.
