# The letter

An [Adventure X Jam](https://itch.io/jam/advxjam) game

based on "[The letter](./The%20Letter.pdf)" by Dennis Plöger 

## Current status

* [Sally Beaumont](https://sallybeaumont.com/) and [Dennis Plöger](https://dennis.dieploegers.de) are currently etching
  out a structure for the game, based on the short story
* [Rikard Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/c/RikardPeterson) is on board for the in game music
* We're in need of a graphic artist and animator

## Premise

In the far future, the earth's population has grown so much, that earth can only hardly supply each and every
person. As a drastic countermeasure, the world government (called the "Council") ordered, that all old people
from a certain age on are randomly chosen and... killed. This event, dubbed "The Demise", is the most
fearful thing for the people, which usually see a world of peace and well-being.

The game follows Ben, who just received a official letter from the Council. Could it be, that he is ordered
for "The Demise"? Or is it just something harmless? He's only sixty-eight and "The Demise" usually starts
at seventy. So it can't be!

Or can it?

## Setting

While we're in the future (The year's 2913), the game's setting and proposed visual style is mainly something
like the 1990s with some small, fancy additions.

So far (work in progress) Sally and Dennis are thinking about some kind of [Diorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorama)
kind of game (think [Samorost games](https://amanita-design.net/games/samorost-2.html)). So a static,
atmospheric background with clickable hotspots that trigger animations and drive the story forward.

Additionally, we aim for voice support and background music.

The game will most probably be done in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
